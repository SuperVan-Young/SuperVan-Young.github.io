I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the School of Integrated Circuits, Peking University, advised by Prof.
Guangyu Sun. My current research area mainly focuses on System-Technology Co-Optimization (STCO) and design automation. I hope that the next-generation domain-specific computing system in the post-Moore era could benefit from the joint optimization of application, compilation, architecture, circuit and technology.

I obtained my B.S. degree in Computer Science and Technology from the School of EECS at Peking University
in 2023. During the undergraduate study, I mainly worked on efficient AI algorithm and accelerator design. I also have broad research interests including efficient AI, LLM and domain-specific accelerators.
