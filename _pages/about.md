I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the School of Integrated Circuits, Peking University, advised by Prof. Guangyu Sun. 
My current research area mainly focuses on system-technology co-optimization (STCO) and electronic design automation. 
I hope that the next-generation domain-specific computing system in the post-Moore era could benefit from the joint optimization of application, compilation, architecture, circuit and technology.

I obtained my B.S. degree in Computer Science and Technology from the School of EECS at Peking University in 2023. 
During the undergraduate study, I mainly worked on efficient AI algorithm and AI accelerator design. I also have broad research interests including efficient AI, large language models and domain-specific accelerators.
